TO BUILD AND RUN SERIAL VRP (UNIX-LIKE ENVIRONMENTS)
====================================================

1. Download and build the BLIS serial library version 0.93. Please refer to the
INSTALL file in the installation directory for instructions.

2. In BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP, type 'make' to build the executable.

3. Modify parameters if desired. Blis-0.93/Blis/include/BlisParams.h has
explanations of each parameter. There are two ways to specify parameters:
   - parameter file: vrp.par
   - command line

The user must specify:
   - which instance to solve

The users can specify:
   - maximum solution time
   - log level, etc.

4. To run VRP, type 

	BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP/vrp -param vrp.par

   VRP can also read in parameters from command line, for instance

	BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP/vrp -Alps_instance ./data/input3.txt
	
        BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP/vrp -par vrp.par -Alps_instance sample.vrp -Vrp_numRoutes 4  -Alps_timeLimit 600

TO BUILD AND RUN PARALLEL VRP (UNIX_LIKE ENVIRONMENTS)
======================================================

1. Download and build BLIS parallel library version 0.93. Please refer to the
INSTALL file in the installation directory for instructions.

2. In BUILDDIR/Bcps/examples/Blis, type 'make' to build the executable.

3. Modify parameters if desired. Blis-0.93/Alps/include/AlpsParams.h has
explanations of each parameter. There are two ways to specify parameters:
   - parameter file: blis.par
   - command line

The user must specify:
   - which instance to solve
   - how many processes to be launched 

The user can specify:
   - how many hubs
   - maximum solution time
   - log level, etc.

4. The way to run the parallel version depends on users' computing
environment, but in general the command line should look something like

  mpirun -np 8 -machinefile machines BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP/vrp -par vrp.par
Besides setting parameters in vrp.par, you can also set parameters in 
command line, which overrides the parameter values in vrp.par:

  mpirun -np 8 -machinefile machines BUILDDIR/Blis/examples/VRP/vrp -par vrp.par -Alps_instance sample.vrp -Vrp_numRoutes 4 -Alps_hubNum 2
