DisCO (Discrete Conic Optimization) is a solver for Mixed-Iteger Second Order Conic (MISOCO) optimization problem.

DisCO uses OSI conic to communicate with its SOCO solver. COLA, OsiCplex and OsiMosek implements this conic solver interface and DisCO can be used with these solvers.

DisCO is an extension of COIN-OR BLIS solver to second order cone problems.
